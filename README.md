  * Total seats won by alliances
  * State-wise results
  * Tightest winning margins
  * EVM vs. Postal vote breakdown
* **Solutions\_Of\_Problem\_Statements.sql** → Complete queries

---

## 🗺 Data & Model

* **ER Diagram** → `ERD for data.pgerd`
* **Data Modeling PPT** → Explains schema, star model & fact-dimension design

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Objectives

* How many seats did each **alliance** (NDA, INDIA, Others) win?
* Which **states** were the strongest/weakest for each alliance?
* Which constituencies had **closest races**?
